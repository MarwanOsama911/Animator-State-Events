# Animator-State-Events
ASE can help you build custom animator events so you can track the state in the animator component.
You will have 4 events based on the state OnEnter, OnUpdate, OnEnd, and OnExit.
You can use it and replace the animation clip evens so if you change the clip now the events will be attached to the animator and this gives huge flexibility.

## Events Discritpion
- OnEnter Event: will fire when entering the animator state. 
- OnUpdate Event: will fire when reaching the target frame you have set in the animator event script.  
- OnEnd Event: will fire after the state finishes the animation clip and before exit.
- OnExit Event: will fire when exiting the animator the state.
